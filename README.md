# Project
This is Project in Braude college, building a search engine, ML for discovering plant Diseases & Rag!
The project shows a lot of concepts, the first would be the knowledge of indexing and using ranks to save in FIREBASE for finding relative content in search engine.
The second would be the power of building RAG and how can AI using our rag give the best answers! 
The third is ML, the model is not trained enough but here we can see the basics of machine learning & it's power.
